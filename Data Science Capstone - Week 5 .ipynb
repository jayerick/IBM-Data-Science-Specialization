    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "San Jose is one of the largest cities in California, and has a seat in one of the most affluent counties in the country. The city is known for its history of innovation, earning the nickname Silicon Valley due to the countless technology companies that exist in or near the city limits. This includes Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Tesla, Twitter, and many others. However, San Jose is also notoriously known for its incredibly high cost of living. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer a few questions, by analyzing many of the different neighborhoods within San Jose. The audience of this project would be a high-end residential real estate developer. I hope to find the cross section of neighborhoods where the mean income of top 5% residents is above the San Jose average, but the mean housing prices for that neighbrhood is below that of San Jose as a whole. Further, with these neighborhoods selected, I will use the Foursquare data to find which is closest to the highest rated amenities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The developer would then be able to buy land in San Jose that is underpriced, aiming to create a high end community that where they could easily sell the homes to people making well above what is required to live in that neighborhood. "

    "\n",
    "By taking the nearest 100 venues to the neighborhood, I then counted only unique values of venue category types to create my 'Diversity Score.' Using this diversity score, we can see how many different types of venues there are in the first 100 venues that are found by Foursquare. \n",
    "\n",
    "This statistic, I believe, does a good job at developing a diversity score that isn't dependent on the size of a certain neighborhood. If a broad look at the total unique types of venues was done, the score would be biased towards larger neighborhoods, which could be predicted to have automatically more unique venues. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a ratio was taken between the numbr of unique venues and the total number of venues, then neighborhoods with a small amount of venues would most likely have higher scores, without it being clear that a neighborhood with few venues is actually a better neighborhood for diversity.\n",

    "I would have very much liked to use crime data sectioned by neighborhoods in order to provide another statistic to evaluate. One potential flaw in looking at neighborhoods that have below average housing markets is that there may be an increased crime presence there, dragging down the values of the houses. I hope that finding neighborhoods with higher than average top 5% household incomes outweighed this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the San Jose Police Department has a new interactive way of looking at crime data, but the data is not in a shareable format. I tried to somehow pull this data into my own datasets but I ended up being unable to do so.\n",

    "Using this combination of data, as discussed earlier, the neighborhoods with above average income, below average housing prices, and above average 'diversity scores' were Blossom Valley, Downtown, Evergreen, and Santa Teresa.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I was able to use some of my own Subject Matter Expertise (being a resident of San Jose for more than twenty years) to identify the viability of building a living community in these neighborhoods. Downtown San Jose could be thrown out first for a variety of reasons. The first is that it indeed has one of the highest crime rates in San Jose as a whole. The second is that land is very hard to come by, so despite the low valuation of housing, the ability to buy large plots of undeveloped land and develop on it would be very expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Blossom Valley, despite having a reasonably low crime rate, is also industrialized, and the acquisition of land here would similarly be difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves two neighborhoods as final contenders, which would actually both be pretty safe bets for a developer. Both lie on the edge of developed regions of San Jose, meaning that buying land in those neighborhoods would be feasible. The main difference lies in the diversity score. Santa Teresa is much closer to a wide variety of different venues, and could therefore be considered a better area to develop in. Not to mention, housing prices are lower here in a larger magnitude than the 5% household incomes, so we could infer that households in Santa Teresa could afford to move into a nicer housing development, and still feel at home (since they would not be leaving there immediate neighborhoods. \n",

    "\n",

    "Given all of this, the final reccomendation to a high end residential developer would be to build a housing community that could attract a diverse crowd of people, with higher than average incomes in San Jose.\n"
