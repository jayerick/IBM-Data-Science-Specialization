    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "San Jose is one of the largest cities in California, and has a seat in one of the most affluent counties in the country. The city is known for its history of innovation, earning the nickname Silicon Valley due to the countless technology companies that exist in or near the city limits. This includes Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Tesla, Twitter, and many others. However, San Jose is also notoriously known for its incredibly high cost of living. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer a few questions, by analyzing many of the different neighborhoods within San Jose. The audience of this project would be a high-end residential real estate developer. I hope to find the cross section of neighborhoods where the mean income of top 5% residents is above the San Jose average, but the mean housing prices for that neighbrhood is below that of San Jose as a whole. Further, with these neighborhoods selected, I will use the Foursquare data to find which is closest to the highest rated amenities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The developer would then be able to buy land in San Jose that is underpriced, aiming to create a high end community that where they could easily sell the homes to people making well above what is required to live in that neighborhood. "
